Tiny go program to generate text centred in = signs.

Each argument is its own piece of text, and for now the width is fixed to 30 characters.

```
» go get github.com/telyn/centre

» centre "Ingredients" "Precautions" "Method"
========================= Ingredients =========================
========================= Precautions =========================
=========================== Method ============================
```
